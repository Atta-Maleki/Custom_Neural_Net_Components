# Custom_Neural_Net_Components
How to customize any components of a Neural Network?
We can replace any component of NN with a personalized or modified version.
This Repo contains some useful codes for people interstead in building a Neural Network from skratch. you will even see how the Gradient descent works and you will be able to write your own gradient descent function. if you are interested why this is important to costumize each component. Answer is that it is not that important if you are just using the application of NN for your projects and it is not your field, but if you want to know how it works and what happens in deeper parts of the back-stage have a look at codes inside the repo.
